    <h1>Le-Anh Crump</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is LeAnh Crump. I'm originally from Denver, CO. I am a junior and my intended major is software engineering as I find a career in tech very interesting and competitive. I recently transferred from CU Boulder to UNCO because they are the only University in the state that offers a BS in SWE. I am apart of Stryker, DSF, COSI, HOSA and I am currently starting an organization at UNC for Women in Software Engineering (or tech! Please message me if you are interested in learning about it!). </p>
