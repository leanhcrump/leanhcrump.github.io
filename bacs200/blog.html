					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>Maybe climate change seems far off in the future, or that it's inveitable and you might as well not work to solve the problem. 
					<br> Here are a list of things that global warming will change for us socially in the near future:
					<ol style="list-style-type: square">
						<li>It may be too hot to hangout outside, in seasons other than summer.</li>
						<li>Natural disasters such as drought, flooding, wildfires, hurricanes etc. will happen more frequently.</li>
						<li>Drought can harm food production.</li>
						<li>Water levels rise and wipe out costal homes and businesses</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>The results of all these little changes to our world build up and can impact the economy in a couple of different ways. Natural disasters will result in the need for more financial allocation to prevention and impact. Insurance against natural disasters may skyrocket as it would be in high demand. More tax money would also be needed to be allocated to create shelters for natural disasters, response teams, and infrastructure rebuilding.https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts#:~:text=The%20impacts%20of%20climate%20change%20on%20different%20sectors%20of%20society,availability%2C%20and%20limit%20worker%20productivity. </p>
