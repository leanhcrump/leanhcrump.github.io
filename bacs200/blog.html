				<p>Americans are starting to see the results of the warming of our planet. What will need to happen before people take action to change their daily habits contributing to the warming, and boycott or protest current investments known to emit CO2 and greenhouse gasses.</p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					Maybe climate change seems far off in the future, or that it's inveitable and you might as well not work to solve the problem. 
					<br> Here are a list of things that global warming will change for us socially in the near future:
					<ol style="list-style-type: square; background-color:lightblue;">
						<li>It may be too hot to hangout outside, in seasons other than summer.</li>
						<li>Natural disasters such as drought, flooding, wildfires, hurricanes etc. will happen more frequently.</li>
						<li>Drought can harm food production.</li>
						<li>Water levels rise and wipe out costal homes and businesses</li>
					</ol>
					 In addition to the personal and societal effects that we will face due to climate change, the economics and money that runs our would will also have implications.

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>The results of all these little changes to our world build up and can impact the economy in a couple of different ways. Natural disasters will result in the need for more financial allocation to prevention and impact. Insurance against natural disasters may skyrocket as it would be in high demand. More tax money would also be needed to be allocated to create shelters for natural disasters, response teams, and infrastructure rebuilding. On the other hand, businesses will have more opportunity for growth financially by investing in renewable business practices. This can also help boost customer loyalaty as many in our current century believe that corporations have social responsibilities such as global warming. </p>

				<section class="implication" id="imp-political">
					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>The effects of climate change will disporportionately affect marginalized communities. Our political leaders must do what is in the best interest of our community and protect all individuals from these disasters. Many will be displaced by hurricanes and even killed. Prevention matters must be within our policy as the frequency of natural disasters rising is no longer a conspiricy, but something regarded as a fact within the scientific community. USA Today recently published an article on the scientific reports of the next large earthquake.<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/03/02/californias-big-one-among-other-disasters/9111798002/?gnt-cfr=1">Learn More ...</a> </p>

				<section id="conclusion">
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>The consensus within the scientific community is that we will see the effects of global warming exponentially grow in our daily lives. We need to take action sooner than later within our political economy to salvage the lives of many and boost our economy as a whole. As hopeless and terrifying as it might seem, we are not too far gone. We can help prepare on an indivudal and community level, we can choose to support businesses who support renewable resources and defund fossil fuels, and lastly we can call our local governmental leaders and express our grave concerns about how life will change within the next couple of years. </p>
