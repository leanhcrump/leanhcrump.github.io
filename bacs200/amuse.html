    <h2>Top Laugh</h2>
    <p>When I think of shitpost images on the web, this is usually the first one that comes to mind.  Everyone's sense of humor is different, but maybe you'll find it hilarious as well! Personally I find this amusing because I love dogs</p>

    <h2>Jotchua Remix</h2>
    <p> The remixes of Jotchua always bring me joy. Here is a "Blingee" version. Blingee was a very popular web app in the early 2000's where you can customize your picture with blingee gifs.</p>

    <h2>Meme Overuse</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, when a meme gets to the point where it is printable on stickers and mugs, maybe it has become too mainstream.. : <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/shop/jotchua+meme+travel-mugs">Redbubble mugs</a></p>
